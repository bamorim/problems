# Problems

This repository is to keep track of my attempts to sovle problems from different sources.

For now I'm solving problems from:

- [*Project Euler*](https://projecteuler.net/): Mathematical/Computer programming problems. Language agnostic
- [*exercism.io*](http://exercism.io/): Solve problems in different programming languages and get feedback about how to improve your skills in each language.
- [*Rosalind*](http://rosalind.info/): Bioinformatic problems

I'm planning to also solve:
- [*HackerRank*](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [*CodeEval*](https://www.codeeval.com/)
- *X-99*: There are plenty of versions derivated from P-99 (Prolog 99 problems), scala, haskell, lisp and so on...

To see what problems I've solved, check [*SOLVED.md*](SOLVED.md)
